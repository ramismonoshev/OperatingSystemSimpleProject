# OperatingSystemSimpleProject
In this project, I have been thinking about various page replacement algorithms that an Operating System implementer may choose to use. In this project, you can compare the results of four different algorithms on traces of memory references. While simulating an algorithm you can collect statistics about its performance such as the number of page faults that occur and the number of dirty frames that had to be written back to disk. 
Covers an emulation of the page-replacement algorithms like : First In First Out, Least Recently Used, Optimal, Least Frequently Used, Second Chance, and Enhanced Second Chance.
